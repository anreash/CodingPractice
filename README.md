# CodingPractice
This is a collection of the Coding Practices and Challenges Iâ€™ve done in Edabit, CodeWars, and other related sites.

The codes here are not to be revised.
However, you are free to add comments.

Notes:
- Better solutions refer to solutions given by other people, unless I stated that I made them.
- I'll also be including some of my observations and learnings based on the challenges I've answered.
- Dates of the coding challenges are on the file name as mmddyy.
- Most of the Coding Challenges are done in C++.
